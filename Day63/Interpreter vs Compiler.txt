Interpreter : 
            1. Translates program one statement at a time.
            2. It takes less time to analyze the source code.
		3. No object Code can be created
		4. JavaScript,Python can use Interpreters.
		5. Slower than compilers.




Compiler :
	      1.  Scans the entire program and Translates it as a whole into machine code.
            2. It takes more time to analyze the source code.
		3. Object Code can be created
		4. Java,C,C++ can use Compilers.
		5. Faster than Interpreters.
