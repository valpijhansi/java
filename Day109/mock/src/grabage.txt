Java Garbage Collection:

In java, garbage means unreferenced objects.

Garbage Collection is process of reclaiming the runtime unused memory automatically. In other words, it is a way to destroy the unused objects.

To do so, we were using free() function in C language and delete() in C++. But, in java it is performed automatically. So, java provides better memory management.



Advantage of Garbage Collection

    It makes java memory efficient because garbage collector removes the unreferenced objects from heap memory.
    It is automatically done by the garbage collector(a part of JVM) so we don't need to make extra efforts.
