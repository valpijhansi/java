-> java 15 introduced the concept of sealed classes.
-> Java sealed classes and interfaces restrict that which classes and interfaces may extend or implement them.
-> In other words, we can say that the class that cannot be inherited but can be instantianted is knows as the sealed class.
-> It allos classes and interfaces to have more control over their permitted subtypes.
-> This concept only preview feature, not a permanent feature.

Advantages :

   -> It allows permission to the subclasses that can extend the sealed superclasss.
   -> It makes superclass broadly accessible but not broadly extensible.
