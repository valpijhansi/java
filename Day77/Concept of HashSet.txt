HashSet : 
         A HashSet is a collection of items where every item is unique,and it is found in the java.util package.
         It Implements the Set interface,backed by a hash table which is actually a HashMap instance
         Duplicates values are not allowed.
         Null elements are allowed.

Methods of HashSet:
                    add();
                    clear();
                    contains(object o);
                    remove(object o);
                    iterator();
                    isEmpty();
                    size();
                    clone();
                



                                         HashMap vs HashSet

                         HashMap                                      HashSet
                
                This is core difference among               HashSet implements Set interface.
                them.HashMap implements map 
                interface.

                It store data in a form of                  It uses add(value) method for storing data
                key->value pair.So it uses
                put(key,value) methid for
                storing data.

                HashMap allows duplicate value              HashSet does not allow duplicate values.
                but not duplicate keys.

                It is faster tha hashset as                 It is slower than Hashmap
                values are stored with unique
                keys.
