            1.Can traverse elements present in Collection           Can traverse elements present in Collectionboth in forward

              only in the forward direction.                          and backword directions
.
            2.Helps to traverse Map,List and Set.                   Can only traverse List and not the other two.

            3.Indexes cannot be obtained by using Iterator.         It has methods like nextIndex() and previousIndex() to obtain Indexesof elements at any time while traversing

            4.Cannot modify or replace elements present              We can modify or replace elements with the help of set(E e)
              in Collection.
