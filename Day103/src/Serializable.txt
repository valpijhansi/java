Serialization : 

                    Serialization is a mechanism of converting the state of an object into a byte stream. 
                    It is mainly used in Hibernate, RMI, JPA, EJB and JMS technologies.
                    It is mainly used to travel object's state on the network (that is known as marshalling).
                    The Serializable interface must be implemented by the class whose object needs to be persisted.

DeSerialization:   

                 The reverse operation of serialization is called deserialization where byte-stream is converted into an object.
