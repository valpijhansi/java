RegularExpression(regex) :
                            A regular expression is a sequence of characters that forms a search Pattern.
                            It can be a single character, or a more complicated Pattern.
                            It can be used to perform all types of text search and text replace.
                            Java Does not have a bulit-in Regular expression class but we can import "java.util.regex".
