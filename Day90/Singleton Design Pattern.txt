Singleton Design Pattern :
                       
                         The singleton pattern is one of the simplest design patterns.
                          Sometimes we need to have only one instance of our class for example a single DB connection shared by multiple objects as creating a separate DB connection for every object may be costly. 
                          Similarly, there can be a single configuration manager or error manager in an application that handles all problems instead of creating multiple managers.

                          In simple words it means that singleton pattern is a design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one object.
