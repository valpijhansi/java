StringBuilder :
                StringBuilder in Java represents a mutable sequence of characters. 
                Since the String Class in Java creates an immutable sequence of characters, 
                the StringBuilder class provides an alternative to String Class, as it creates a mutable sequence of characters. 
                The function of StringBuilder is very much similar to the StringBuffer class, as both of them provide an alternative to String Class by making a mutable sequence of characters.

StringBuffer : StringBuffer is a peer class of String that provides much of the functionality of strings. 
               The string represents fixed-length, immutable character sequences while StringBuffer represents growable and writable character sequences.

StringBuffer is present in Java.	                    StringBuilder was introduced in Java 5.
StringBuffer is synchronized.                           StringBuilder is asynchronized. 


This means that multiple threads cannot 
call the methods of StringBuffer simultaneously.	   
                                                        This means that multiple threads can call the methods of StringBuilder simultaneously.

Due to synchronization, StringBuffer is called
 a thread safe class.	                                 Due to its asynchronous nature, StringBuilder is not a thread safe class.


Due to synchronization, 
StringBuffer is lot slower than StringBuilder.          Since there is no preliminary check for multiple threads,
                                                         StringBuilder is a lot faster than StringBuffer.
